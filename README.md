WHAT IS IT?
===========

Seamlist aims to provide a web interface to search through old messages.

WHY?
====

Searching through mailing lists is annoying.

At Olin, we use Mailman, and we have to download the archives in order to find responses to old emails.
With seamlist, we won't have to.

THE TECH
=========

- python
